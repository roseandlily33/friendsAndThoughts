# Friends and Thoughts
Challenge #18 Social Network API

## Description
Using mongoDB, create a API for a social network site that has users, users can have friends, and your users can react and make posts. 
Technologies that I used are express, mongoose, mongoDB, and moment.

I had a couple things that were already copied when it came to the userId's so that it could go faster and there would be less jumping back and forth. 

## What I Learned:
I learned about mongoDB, I must say it has been one of the easier technologies to learn and I really enjoyed how it performed and how straight forward it was to use. I learned how to filter on attributes being displayed and more on how to use moment. Another thing was doing the routes this way with having the routes and controllers being seperated which took a minute to get used to but I think that I prefer it. 

## Difficulties
Some difficulties that I had was mainly with the Thought and Reaction model not being pulled in correctly and then having some issues with certain forms of the id not working. 

## Successes:
Some successes that I had was setting up the schemas, filtering on attributes, getting the virtuals going and populating, getting mongoDB all set up and working, sorting throught the routes.
